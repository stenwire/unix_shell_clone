## Goal of Project
Th goal of this project is to implement a simple Unix shell -- What is a Unix shell? A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command-line user interface for Unix-like operating systems.  The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.
Users typically interact with a Unix shell using a terminal emulator; however, direct operation via serial hardware connections or Secure Shell is common for server systems.  All Unix shells provide filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.[source: Wikipedia]

## Features

From the project instruction, we were asked to replicate some builtins you woul find in a normal unix shell, along with that we were also tasked with some features of the normal unix shell. Some of these builtins and features we weere able to replicate are highlighted in the table below and vice versa.

```
-----> Requirement
* Any Ubuntu distribution
* GCC installed (gcc 9.3.0)
----->
```

Follow below steps to setup locally:
* clone repo: ```git clone https://github.com/stenwire/simple_shell.git```
* change into repo: ```cd simple_shell```
* verify all files
* Compile: ```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh```
* Run the shell in interactive mode: ```./hsh``` or run the shell in non-interactive mode: ```echo "<your command here>" | ./hsh ```
